For 25 points, write a program called Prime1 which reads an endless sequence of integers from stdin and tests whether each number is prime or not and prints a meaningful message to stdout, if it is. Example program output is shown below. Place all your code in "Prime1.cpp" including function "isprime(int)" which is a boolean function that does all the checking. As usual, the endless input ends when CTRL-D is encountered.
For 35 points, write a modified version of Prime1 called Prime2. Move the "isprime(int)" code into a class called "isprime" that overloads its function operator to act as a function object. Instantiate an "isprime" object in the main program and use it to test the input data. The program output is as shown below.
