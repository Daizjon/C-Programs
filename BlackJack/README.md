Blackjack is a simple and popular card game. A player competes with a dealer with the goal of coming as close to 21 as possible without going over. Players that exceed 21 lose; if the final value is less than 21, the dealer takes cards up until 17 or higher. If the player's value is higher, they win; otherwise they lose.
